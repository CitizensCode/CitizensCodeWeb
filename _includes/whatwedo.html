                    <p class="text-muted">When it comes to open data, we're the doers. But sometimes you can't <em>do</em> anything until you have the data you need. And data lives in all kinds of hard to reach places: from filing cabinets at city hall, to outdated databases to oh-so-beautiful-but-impossible-to-use PDF files. When necessary, we put in the hard work to make this data available for public consumption.</p>

We make sure the data sets are organized and accessible through formats that have widely available tooling to consume and use. JSON and us are best buds.</p>
